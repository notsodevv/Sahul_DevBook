## Stacks

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. It allows elements to be added and removed only from one end, known as the top of the stack. Stacks are widely used in programming and real-life scenarios for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and undo operations. Let's explore the concepts related to stacks:

### 1. Introduction

A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, while pop removes the topmost element. Additionally, stacks may support other operations like peek (to view the top element without removing it) and isEmpty (to check if the stack is empty).

### 2. Operations on Stacks

#### a. Push Operation

Pushing an element onto the stack involves placing it on top of the existing elements. This operation increases the stack size by one.

#### b. Pop Operation

Popping an element from the stack removes the topmost element. This operation decreases the stack size by one.

#### c. Peek Operation

Peeking allows you to view the top element of the stack without removing it. This operation does not modify the stack.

#### d. isEmpty Operation

The isEmpty operation checks if the stack is empty. It returns true if the stack contains no elements and false otherwise.

### 3. Time Complexity

Stack operations typically have constant time complexity (O(1)) since they involve accessing and modifying only the top element of the stack.

### 4. Applications

Stacks find applications in various scenarios, including:

- **Function Call Management:** Stacks are used to manage function calls and store local variables and return addresses.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are employed to evaluate arithmetic expressions, infix to postfix conversion, and balancing parentheses.
- **Undo Operations:** Stacks facilitate undo functionalities in text editors, graphic design software, and web browsers.
- **Backtracking Algorithms:** Stacks support backtracking algorithms in maze solving, pathfinding, and depth-first search.

### Conclusion

Stacks are versatile data structures that offer efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval operations. Understanding stacks is essential for solving various problems and implementing algorithms in computer science and software development.
